OMG ICFP FTW

Remote group of friends of friends in the US.

We were pretty disorganized and built a number of things.

Some of the packages we made:

## aray - python utilities for this years contest

Just a bunch of utilities, including auto submissions, and a bunch of geometry processing and rendering.

(All the drawing is done with matplotlib, a python plotting library, not very fancy)

## gosh_dangit_its_them_ortools_boys_again - ortools CP-SAT based solver.

both solver.py and edgy.py are implementations of this, the basic idea is:
* create optimization variables (x and y positions of pose points)
* enumerate a bunch of constraints on the variables
* run the solver and either get a set of solutions or just a single solution

## cc_gang, or "the crumbler" - a c++ based solver that does a force-based simulated-annealing-like thing
* also has a visualizer to watch it run
* found a bunch of solutions to problems too big for SAT solver

## judge - a rust based solution verifier
* very good for catching bugs in the solutions presented by our solvers
* uses geo for polygons and geometry stuff

## vaniver - a python based approach to randomly constructing valid solutions
* this would pick points and build up a pose, backtracking if it were inconsistent
* has some heuristics to find better scoring / more likely to be valid points

# Other cruft that was lying around
* an attempt at a gradient based optimization approach (in different branch, never worked)
* a rewrite of `vaniver` into Rust (in different branch)
* beginnings of a Rust based constructive pose builder
